abstract = {A training algorithm that maximizes the margin between the training patterns and the decision boundary is presented. The technique is applicable to a wide variety of the classification functions, including Perceptrons, polynomials, and Radial Basis Functions. The effective number of parameters is adjusted automatically to match the complexity of the problem. The solution is expressed as a linear combination of supporting patterns. These are the subset of training patterns that are closest to the decision boundary. Bounds on the generalization performance based on the leave-one-out method and the VC-dimension are given. Experimental results on optical character recognition problems demonstrate the good generalization obtained when compared with other learning algorithms.},

As the dependence upon computers and computer networks grows, the need for authentication has increased. Biometrics is the science and technology of authentication by identifying the living individual's physiological or behavioral attributes. Keystroke dynamics is a behavioral measurement and it utilizes the manner and rhythm in which each individual types. The approaches in keystroke dynamics can be categorized by the selection of features and the classification methods employed. The objective of this review paper is to summarize the well-known approaches used in keystroke dynamics in the last two decades.}
